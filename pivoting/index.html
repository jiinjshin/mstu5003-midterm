            <p>"The pivot is a way of taking a question that might be on a specific subject, and moving to answer it on your own terms," -Brett O'Donnell (Debate Consultant)</p>

            <p>During debates, candidates use pivots ""better than 60 or 70 percent of the time" -O'Donnell</p>
            <p>Viewers at home rarely recognize when candidates pivot to distract them from the moderator's original question so that they can convey something else.  Viewers then feel that the candidate has answered the question satisfactorily, and make an (uninformed) judgment of the candidate.</p>
            <p>How does this happen? These debates were created to inform the American public of candidates' positions on important issues, but has instead become a platform for candidates to manipulate innocent people. Todd Rogers, a behavioral Psychologist at the Harvard Kennedy School, says that the average person's focus when watching a debate is to judge whether or not they are good people. Their minds are then geared towards determining character, not aligning the question to the answer. If the answer sounds somewhat related, they have accomplished their goal of determining a candidate's character based on his or her response regardless of relevance.</p>

              <p>Now that you are familiar with pivoting, you should have the necessary skills to discern when a candidate is dodging a question he doesn't want to answer.</p>
              <p>Before you vote for a politician, whether it's for the 2016 Presidential Election or for local office, make sure you're getting the answers you deserve. </p>
              <p>I challenge you to rewatch previous debates to see whether or not your candidate is <i>really</i> answering the right question!</p>
